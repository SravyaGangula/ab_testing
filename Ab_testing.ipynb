    "\n",
    "Business Scenerio : I work on the product team at a medium-sized online e-commerce business. The UX designer worked really hard on a new version of the product page, with the hope that it will lead to a higher conversion rate. The product manager (PM) told you that the current conversion rate is about 13% on average throughout the year, and that the team would be happy with an increase of 2%, meaning that the new design will be considered a success if it raises the conversion rate to 15%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution You provide : Before rolling out the change, the team would be more comfortable testing it on a small number of users to see how it performs, so you suggest running an A/B test on a subset of your user base users."

    "# Formulating a hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "First things first, we want to make sure we formulate a hypothesis at the start of our project. This will make sure our interpretation of the results is correct as well as rigorous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given we don't know if the new design will perform better or worse (or the same?) as our current design, we'll choose a two-tailed test:\n",
    "\n",
    " H0: p = p0 (Conversion rate of old and new page is same.)\n",
    " H1: p != p0 (Conversion rate of old and new page is not same.)\n",
    "where p & p0 and stand for the conversion rate of the new and old design, respectively. We'll also set a confidence level of 95%:\n",
    "alpa = 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The alpha value is a threshold we set, by which we say \"if the probability of observing a result as extreme or more (-value) is lower than alpha, then we reject the null hypothesis\". Since our alpha = 0.05(indicating 5% probability), our confidence (1 - alpha) is 95%\n",
    "\n",
    "I.e: whatever conversion rate we observe for our new design in our test, we want to be 95% confident it is statistically different from the conversion rate of our old design, before we decide to reject the Null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Choosing the variables:\n",
    "For our test we'll need two groups:\n",
    "\n",
    " A control group - They'll be shown the old design\n",
    " A treatment (or experimental) group - They'll be shown the new design\n",
    " \n",
    "This will be our Independent Variable. The reason we have two groups even though we know the baseline conversion rate is that we want to control for other variables that could have an effect on our results, such as seasonality: by having a control group we can directly compare their results to the treatment group, because the only systematic difference between the groups is the design of the product page, and we can therefore attribute any differences in results to the designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For our Dependent Variable (i.e. what we are trying to measure), we are interested in capturing the conversion rate. A way we can code this is by each user session with a binary variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "0 - The user did not buy the product during this user session.\n",
    "1 - The user bought the product during this user session.\n",
    "This way, we can easily calculate the mean for each group to get the conversion rate of each design.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Choosing a sample size:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that since we won't test the whole user base (our population), the conversion rates that we'll get will inevitably be only estimates of the true rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The number of people (or user sessions) we decide to capture in each group will have an effect on the precision of our estimated conversion rates: the larger the sample size, the more precise our estimates (i.e. the smaller our confidence intervals), the higher the chance to detect a difference in the two groups, if present.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the larger our sample gets, the more expensive (and impractical) our study becomes.\n",
    "So how many people should we have in each group?\n",
    "\n",
    "# The sample size we need is estimated through something called Power analysis, and it depends on a few factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Power of the test (1-beta) - This represents the probability of finding a statistical difference between the groups in our test when a difference is actually present. This is usually set at 0.8 as a convention (here's more info on statistical power, if you are curious)\n",
    "Alpha value: - The critical value we set earlier to 0.05\n",
    "Effect size - How big of a difference we expect there to be between the conversion rates\n",
    "Since our team would be happy with a difference of 2%, we can use 13% and 15% to calculate the effect size we expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, Python takes care of all these calculations for us:"
